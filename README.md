## TODOs

- [ ] Ensure you have a working LaTeX setup so you can compile the provided templates to PDF.
    - See our online guide at <https://hogenttin.github.io/latex-hogent-gids/>. Remark that it's only in Dutch, so you might want to use the built-in translation feature of your web browser if you don't understand Dutch.
    - Be sure to install the fonts required by the HOGENT corporate identity, as [described in the guide](https://hogenttin.github.io/latex-hogent-gids/hogent-huisstijl/)!
- [ ] Add group name and member names to the table above
- [ ] Keep all your work that prepares for the group assignment in this repository. Use Markdown files for notes.
- [ ] Use the template in the `prep` folder for the written preparation of your research proposals, and compile it to PDF (e.g. using the provided Makefile, or with your own LaTeX setup). Rename the file as `rm-YYYY-groep-NN.tex` (where `YYYY` is the current academic year - e.g. 2526- and `NN` is your group number). Replace "groep" with "group" you are enrolled in the English variant of this course.
- [ ] Use the template in the `pitch` folder to create a slide deck for your pitch presentation.
- [ ] Remove these instructions, add a short introduction to the work your team will be presenting, and a table of contents linking to your notes.

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ **PAY ATTENTION!** Your group's repository will be deleted before the start of the course next academic year. **Take a backup if you want to keep your work!**
